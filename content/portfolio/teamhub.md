## Overview

TeamHub is an enterprise-grade collaboration platform designed for remote and hybrid teams. It combines the best features of project management, team chat, and document collaboration tools into a single, cohesive experience.

## The Challenge

TeamHub Technologies had a vision to reduce the tool fragmentation that plagues modern teams. They wanted to create a platform that could replace multiple subscriptions while providing a superior user experience.

Key challenges included:
- Building real-time collaboration features at scale
- Creating a seamless experience across web and desktop
- Ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Designing an intuitive interface despite feature complexity

## Our Solution
