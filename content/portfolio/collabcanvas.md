## Overview

CollabCanvas turns group ideation into structured creation. Teams work together on an infinite canvas with AI helping to organize, suggest, and fill gaps—ideal for remote work, clubs, or creative friends.

## The Challenge

Remote collaboration tools often feel rigid or overwhelming. CollabCanvas needed fluidity and intelligence. Key challenges included:

- Enabling smooth real-time multi-user editing
- Integrating helpful AI without overpowering human input
- Handling diverse project types (mind maps, prototypes, notes)
- Maintaining performance on large, complex canvases

## Our Solution

We built CollabCanvas with Electron and React for desktop/web reliability, plus WebSockets for instant sync. AI acts as a smart moderator to keep sessions productive.

### Key Features Developed

**Infinite Canvas Editing**
Simultaneous drawing, sticky notes, and text with AI auto-layout and suggestions.

**AI Moderator Tools**
Summarizes discussions, proposes next steps, and resolves content overlaps.

**Voice/Video Integration**
Built-in chat and calls synced with canvas actions.

**Export & Prototyping**
One-click exports to presentations, docs, PDFs, or interactive prototypes.

## Results

- **60,000+** team sessions created in launch period
- **4.8 star** average rating
- **55%** reduction in meeting follow-up time reported
- Popular among indie creators and remote teams
